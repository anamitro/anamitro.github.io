Hi, I am Anamitro. Currently, I am an Institute Junior Research Fellow of Mathematics at [Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai](https://iitbhilai.ac.in). You may find me in the math department, in the 2nd and 3rd floors of SD-2 building in the Academic Block here.

I have completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [National Institute of Technology Silchar](http://maths.nits.ac.in/) (India) in 2023. [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](http://maths.nits.ac.in/juthika/) was my advisor for the M.Sc. Thesis titled *Coast of a fuzzy set as a ‘crisper’ subset of the boundary*. Here is a copy of the thesis that is available in NIT Silchar library: [<kbd> <br> **PDF** <br> </kbd>](files/anamitro_thesis_old.pdf). My **CV** is  [here](files/anamitro_cv.pdf).

You may **email** me at anamitroappu@gmail.com. You may find preprints of my research [here](research.md), and schedules and handouts of my talks [here](talks.md). You can find me in IIT Bhilai campus or else in Kolkata, unless I am out travelling. Here in the picture I am on a short trek, near Pragbodhi caves at Lodogama; on the very hills where Lord Buddha lived for quite some time as an ascetic.
