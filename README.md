Institute Junior Research Fellow of Mathematics at <a href="https://iitbhilai.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai</a>.
<br><br>
During daytime on weekdays, you'll find me in Room no. 313, level 3, SD-2 block. On weekends, I am generally far from office: at my home in Kolkata or at my friend's Chinmaya's home in Bargarh close by. I have completed M.Sc. in Mathematics from <a href="http://maths.nits.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a> (India). [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](http://maths.nits.ac.in/juthika/) supervised my M.Sc. thesis, titled *Coast of a fuzzy set as a 'crisper' subset of the boundary*. [<kbd> <br> **M.Sc. Thesis** <br> </kbd>](files/anamitro_thesis_old.pdf) [<kbd> <br> **CV** <br> </kbd>](files/anamitro_cv.pdf)
<br><br>
I can speak Bengali (first language), English (IELTS score band 8.0), Sanskrit and Hindi. I can understand Oriya, Punjabi and Maithili (can't read the, though).
