I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [National Institute of Technology Silchar](http://maths.nits.ac.in/) (India) in 2023. [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](http://maths.nits.ac.in/juthika/) was my advisor for the **M.Sc. Thesis** titled *Coast of a fuzzy set as a ‘crisper’ subset of the boundary*.

My **CV** is  [here](files/anamitro_cv.pdf). You may **email** me at anamitroappu@gmail.com. Right now, you can find me in Kolkata, unless I am out travelling. Here I am on a short trek, near Pragbodhi caves at Lodogama; on the very hills where Lord Buddha lived for quite some time as an ascetic.

## Research interest:
Number Theory, and its interactions with Algebraic Geometry. I am deeply intrigued by the distribution of prime numbers and density theorems. I wish to work in analytic and algebraic number theory in future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously also worked in Fuzzy Topology and Additive Combinatorics. In fuzzy topology I am particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of fuzzy boundary. In Additive Number Theory, I have worked on zero-sum problems, and on its connections with affine geometry.
