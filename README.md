## About me

Research scholar, Department of Mathematics, <a href="https://iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=dept_math">Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai</a>.
<br><br>
You’ll find me in Room no. 317, level 3, SD-2 building in the Academic Block. Or, in Kolkata. Or, travelling.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I have completed M.Sc. in Mathematics from <a href="http://maths.nits.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a> (India). [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](https://maths.nits.ac.in/faculties/juthika-mahanta) supervised my M.Sc. thesis, which was on Fuzzy Topology.
