## About me

Research scholar, Department of Mathematics, <a href="https://iitbhilai.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai</a>.
<br><br>
During daytime on weekdays, you'll find me in Room no. 313, level 3, SD-2 building in the Academic Block. On weekends, I am generally far from office: at my home in Kolkata or at my friend's Chinmaya's home in Bargarh close by.
<br><br>
**My Erdős number is 4.**
<br><br>
I have completed M.Sc. in Mathematics from <a href="http://maths.nits.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a> (India). [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](http://maths.nits.ac.in/juthika/) supervised my M.Sc. thesis, titled *Coast of a fuzzy set as a 'crisper' subset of the boundary*. [<kbd> <br> **M.Sc. Thesis 📕** <br> </kbd>](files/anamitro_thesis_old.pdf)
<br><br>
I can speak Bengali (first language), English, Sanskrit and Hindi. I can understand Oriya, Punjabi and Maithili by listening (can't read, though).
