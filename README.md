Research scholar, Department of Mathematics, <a href="https://iitbhilai.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai</a>.
<br><br>
During daytime on weekdays, you'll find me in Room no. 313, level 3, SD-2 block. On weekends, I am generally far from office: at my home in Kolkata or at my friend's Chinmaya's home in Bargarh close by.
<br><br>
I have completed M.Sc. in Mathematics from <a href="http://maths.nits.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a> (India). [Dr. Juthika Mahanta](http://maths.nits.ac.in/juthika/) supervised my M.Sc. thesis, titled *Coast of a fuzzy set as a 'crisper' subset of the boundary*. [<kbd> <br> **M.Sc.

I can speak Bengali (first language), English (IELTS score band 8.0), Sanskrit and Hindi. I can understand Oriya, Punjabi and Maithili (can't read, though).

>>>> **Add-on:** The bounds for $D_r$ given by the formula proposed in this paper, can be calculated for groups upto rank 3, and the cycle lengths having in all at most 3 prime factors, using [this R program](https://github.com/anamitro/d-r-bounds). Prime $p_2$ has powers $e_1, e_2, e_3$ in ascending order, $p_2$ has powers $f_1, f_2, f_3$ in ascending order and $p_3$ has powers $g_1, g_2, g_3$ in ascending order. The program can be extended similarly for more primes and higher rank.

# Besides Mathematics <a name="hobbies"></a>
I am also interested in

## Painting

Apart from mathematics, I have a serious interest in painting. I initially started by learning styles of the Bengal Renaissance School studying books by Abanindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose, and studying iconography of Indian and East Asian art from various books, most importantly Lady Herringham's compilation of Ajanta mural copies and a Mongolian government publication on Buddhist iconography. Obviously, the styles were adapted with my personal capabilities and inclinations. Some of my paintings are uploaded in [<kbd> <br> this other website <br> </kbd>](https://sites.google.com/view/ani-paint).
