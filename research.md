# My Research


## Papers and pre-prints:

- Anamitro Biswas and Eshita Mazumdar, _Davenport constant for ﬁnite abelian groups with higher rank_, Mathematical Notes, accepted with minor revision. [<kbd> <br> **preprint** <br> </kbd>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09999)

>>>> **Add-on:** The bounds for $D_r$ given by the formula proposed in this paper, can be calculated for groups upto rank 3, and the cycle lengths having in all at most 3 prime factors, using [this R program](https://github.com/anamitro/d-r-bounds). Prime $p_2$ has powers $e_1, e_2, e_3$ in ascending order, $p_2$ has powers $f_1, f_2, f_3$ in ascending order and $p_3$ has powers $g_1, g_2, g_3$ in ascending order. The program can be extended similarly for more primes and higher rank.
