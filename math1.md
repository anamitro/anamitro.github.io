# Mathematics-1, MAL101

Hi, friends!

This unofficial webpage is maintained by me, Anamitro Biswas, teaching assistant for the course. Here I shall upload the complete solutions to the problems done in class, and the tutorial sheets, so that during the class we might focus more on your understanding and on discussion, instead of you formally copying down the solutions from the board. If you have any doubt or question, feel free to get in touch with me through email (anamitrob@iitbhilai.ac.in or anamitroappu@gmail.com), or phone (you have my phone number) or come to SD-2 room no. 313/314 during daytime on weekdays.

Our tutorial classes are scheduled at 2 pm on Wednesdays, at room no. 207 in SD-2 building. The objective of these classes is to discuss problems on the topics that are taught in theory classes.

If you find any mistake in the solution sets, please let me know.

I'd like to know your feedback on the course. This was the first course I taught in, and your response has helped, and will help, me to try to become a better teacher. If you were too shy to point out my errors face-to-face, please let me know your evaluation here. This is informal (the institute has nothing to do with it) and I shall just use it for my own improvement by learning from it.

For exam, don't get the logical sequence of conditions in a definition wrong. For all epsilon > 0, there exists delta > 0 such that [something] holds... write all these carefully and rigorously to get full marks in those questions.

All the best!
