# Mathematics-1, MA101

Hi, friends! This unofficial webpage is maintained by Anamitro Biswas, teaching assistant for the course. Here I shall list the problems done in class, as well as similar problems provided to me by Prof. Arnab Patra, one of the course instructors. I shall also upload the complete solutions to the problems for your conveninece, so that during the class we might focus more on your understanding and on discussion, instead of you guys formally copying down the solutions from the board. If you have any doubt or question, feel free to get in touch with me through email (anamitrob@iitbhilai.ac.in or anamitroappu@gmail.com), or phone (you have my phone number) or come to SD-2 room no. 313/314 during daytime on weekdays.
