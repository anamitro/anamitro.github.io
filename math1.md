# Mathematics-1, MAL101

Hi, friends!

This unofficial webpage is maintained by me, Anamitro Biswas, teaching assistant for the course. Here I shall upload the complete solutions to the problems done in class, and the tutorial sheets, so that during the class we might focus more on your understanding and on discussion, instead of you formally copying down the solutions from the board. If you have any doubt or question, feel free to get in touch with me through email (anamitrob@iitbhilai.ac.in or anamitroappu@gmail.com), or phone (you have my phone number) or come to SD-2 room no. 313/314 during daytime on weekdays.

Our tutorial classes are scheduled at 2 pm on Wednesdays, at room no. 207 in SD-2 building.

If you find any mistake in the solution sets, please let me know.

Since I hurriedly finished the last solutions tonight, there might have remained some mistakes. If you come across one, please point it out to me and to your classmates, so that it doesn't affect tomorrow's exam. All the best!
